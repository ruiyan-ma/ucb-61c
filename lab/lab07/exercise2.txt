Checkoff Question 1: because if the innermost loop is loop i, then all matrices are moved with stride 1
Checkoff Question 2: because in these two cases we need to move through A with stride n and keep loading new data.
Checkoff Question 3: if all matrices are moved with stride 1 in the innermost loop, we will get a better performance.
